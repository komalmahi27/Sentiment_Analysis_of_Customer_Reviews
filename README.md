# Sentiment_Analysis_of_Customer_Reviews
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on customer reviews to classify feedback as positive, negative, or neutral. The dashboard provides key insights into customer sentiments, helping businesses identify areas of improvement and enhance customer experience.


This project involves analyzing customer reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python to understand customer sentiments and improve decision-making. The process includes:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the text by removing stop words, punctuation, and special characters.
Sentiment Classification: Using NLP libraries like NLTK or TextBlob to classify reviews into positive, negative, or neutral categories.
Data Visualization: Plotting the results using Matplotlib or Seaborn to identify sentiment trends and patterns in customer feedback.
This project demonstrates how Python and NLP can be leveraged to gain insights from textual data, helping businesses improve customer satisfaction and address key concerns.
